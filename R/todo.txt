In functions.R:
* Make sure I'm not clustering based on year or name variables. I'm not sure it matters, but I'd better check.
* Pass cluster centroids from one year to another when doing cluster_yr_up
I'm closer on this, but I'm getting some sort of errors. I'll take another swing at it later.

Done?
* Make sure cluster_back() does what it's supposed to.
I think I've got this doing what it's supposed to, but that isn't the full story.
