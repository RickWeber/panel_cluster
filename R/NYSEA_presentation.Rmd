## Background

-   Institutions matter
-   But what *mix* of institutions is best?

## The underlying data: Economic Freedom of the World (EFW)

EFW index combines five sub-indices to create a metric indicating how market-oriented* a country's institutions are

Each on a 1-10 scale with higher numbers indicating more "pro-market"

Previous literature finds higher EFW scores are associated with better outcomes (health, wealth, etc.). See the annual report for details.

*pro-market != pro-business.

## Five areas: 

* Size of Government
* Property Rights
* Sound Money
* Free Trade
* Regulation


## Big question

**Can we convert the quantitative measure of the Economic Freedom of the World index into a qualitative indicator of where a country fits into multi-dimensional "institution space"?**

### Answer: Yes!

## Traditional approach:

Studies using EFW treat it linearly:

* Overall index (e.g. 'how does EFW relate to entrepreneurship?')
* Sub-indices (e.g. 'which area is most important?')

Clustering approach:

* What groups exist in the 5-D EFW space?
* What *combinations* of institutional traits are successful?

## Huskinson and Lawson

-   *Clusters of Economic Freedom* (2014) by Huskinson and Lawson.
-   K-means clustering (k = 4), 2010 data
-   Clustered into "Liberal Market", "Social Democratic", "Poorly Governed Market", and "State Dominated" groups.
-   "Social Democratic" cluster outperformed other groups on GDP/cap, relative and absolute income earned by bottom 10%, life expectancy, and political and civil rights


## Clusters of Economic Freedom Revisited

My contribution: *Clusters of Economic Freedom Revisited* (2021)

Basic approach: Hierarchical Clustering

* Normalize 5 subindices for 2016 data
* Iteratively combine countries/clusters with their nearest neighbors in 5-D space (creating a tree/'Dendrogram')
* Cut the tree at some level to get some number of clusters

For details and code: https://github.com/RickWeber/EFW_clustering

**tl;dr:** Applying clustering techniques to *all* the data captures something that the linear EFW data doesn't capture on its own.

## Outcomes - tests

What do we get from this approach? 

171 models under two simple specifications: 

Some variable of interest as a linear function of EFW overall score and the same thing but with cluster
membership. 

$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 EFW_t$$
$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 EFW_t + \beta_2 Cluster_t$$

## Outcomes - results

* Cluster membership increased $R^2$ by about 0.35 on average.
* This approach captures information that is imperfectly captured by the straight linear EFW
variable.
* It's not just how much freedom you have, but the particular mix. 
* (Which mix? I don't know. I was just looking at the aggregate outcome. You should write a paper using my dataset and cite my paper!)
* (That's slightly overstating things. Basically I found a free cluster, an unfree cluster, and two in-between clusters...)

## Clusters of Economic Freedom Through Time

The initial idea: What groupings (clusters) can we find among different
countries based on their institutional framework (as proxied by the 5
sub indices of the Economic Freedom of the World dataset)?

This follow up: What groupings do we see if we look at countries'
trajectories over time and not just at a given point of time.

## Approach 1: Chained-kmeans

To keep labels from being totally arbitrary, the centroids from one year
are passed into the algorithm to cluster for the following year. This is
still basically clustering one year at a time, but the labels are more
stable than when clustering in total isolation.

## Approach 2: The whole enchilada

Instead of clustering on one year, cluster on the entire dataset so we
are comparing countries in a 125-dimensional space
rather than just a 5-D space.


## Gower distance

If we've got all the data the simplest way to ask "which cluster is Country A closest too?" is to use Euclidean distance.

If some dimensions are missing, that option is off the table. 

Instead, I'll be using "Gower's Distance" which allows a combination of qualitative and quantitative variables.

## Approach 2: Preliminary results

* First world countries cluster together. 
* Countries I would be afraid to travel to cluster together (Chad, Venezuela, Sudan)

## Approach 2: 2018 subindex means

cluster | Area 1 | Area 2 | Area 3 | Area 4 | Area 5 | n
--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+----
1       | 6.52 | 4.43 | 7.53 | 6.32 | 6.61 | 69
2       | 6.94 | 5.50 | 9.06 | 7.79 | 7.48 | 16
3       | 6.27 | 7.62 | 9.43 | 8.28 | 8.34 | 54
4       | 6.19 | 3.50 | 5.75 | 4.43 | 5.43 | 23
Area: |Size of Government |Property Rights|Sound Money|Free Trade|Regulation| n

## Stylized facts

* First world countries are best on all measures except size of government.
  + (Similar to what I saw looking at individual years)
* Basket cases are bad all around
* We should probably be hoping for cluster 2 to get bigger governments over time to better enforce property rights. 
* We should definitely hope cluster 1 countries move in the direction of cluster 2 countries.

## Approach 3: Incorporating time trends

`Under construction...`

This was actually my first instinct when I first started presenting the previous iteration of this project! But it was too complicated to be a useful starting point.

So now I'm trying to clean everything up, set up the code to be relatively generic, and setting myself up to do this approach without all the mess.

## Conclusion

`Under construction...`

I've got a heavy teaching/service load, so this is going to be slow moving for a while. But feel free to mess around with my code. 

I won't be offended if you scoop this project--just list me as a coauthor!
